        <h1>Welcome to Student Points website.</h1>
			<p> Hello and Welcome here at the student points website you will
            find everything you need to know concerning the students points
            Phone App. The Student points apps aims to reward students for
            attending class in college.College we know should be its own reward
            but it can also be stressful this means some students wont attend
            classes because they feel they wont be able to catch up because
            the pressure can be too much.</p>
              </br>
         <h2>What is the SP App?</h2>
            <p>The App offers the students a chance to check in, in college
            using GPS on their phones,this will be checked against the fob data
             to make sure students are actually attending the classes not just
             the college. Prizes will be awarded at the end of the year for top
             3 students, whatever class has top attendance for the year, and top
             student for each year.  We hope that through this App Students will
             find that little extra motivation to get up in the morning and go to
             class. The way this app will work is quite simple, when a student
             gets to college he/she can sign in to the SP (Student Points) app
             and receive their points which will be then held on a leader board
             on our website. Extra Points will be rewarded for unlocking
             achievements for example the “Golden Week” achievement where
             students who attend everyday will be given additional points
             (this will be monitored and a school week according to that
             particular college) or “Give it Socs” where points will be awarded
              for registering with a Society in the college. Also through the
              Point trading system at the end of year students will have the chance
              to compete with one another and put there charisma skills to the test
              by convincing other students to give them some of their points
              (only students in the top 10 of the leader board can
              partake in this).</p>
              </br>
              <h2>Our Aims:</h2>
              <p>We understand that some students in college are a little less motivated
              to go to class or college, in turn this affects the students who are in
              project groups with them. Again we do understand college should be its own reward
              and furthering yourself academically should be the main goal but offering an
              extra incentive to make students come in or rewarding students who study hard
              all year in the long run gives students something to look forward to.
             College can be tough so we hope to invoke a helpful atmosphere by not
              only awarding individual students but awarding a class as a whole that
               everybody helps each other not to fall behind which can be a big reason
              for low attendance in colleges especially among the younger students. We
              aim to help students have a fun and rewarding experience in college
              not just in academics.</p>
